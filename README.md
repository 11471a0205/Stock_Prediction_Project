# **Application of Deep Learning Algorithms in Apple Stock Market
Prediction**

**Overview**

This project focuses on the application of deep learning algorithms to
predict the adjusted closing price of Apple Inc.\'s stock. By leveraging
a comprehensive set of features, this research aims to enhance the
accuracy of stock price predictions, providing insights into the
effectiveness of various deep learning models in the financial domain.

**Objectives**

-   **Evaluate the performance** of different deep learning models for
    predicting Apple stock prices.

-   **Compare traditional four-feature set (High, Low, Volume, Open)**
    with an extended six-feature set (High, Low, Volume, Open, HiLo,
    OpSe) in stock price prediction.

-   **Analyze the impact** of data size and business sector on
    prediction accuracy.

-   **Investigate the performance** of various deep learning models,
    including MLP, GRU, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN, and CNN-LSTM, in predicting
    stock prices.

**Features**

-   Implementation of various deep learning models for stock price
    prediction:

    -   Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

    -   Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

    -   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

    -   Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)

    -   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

    -   Hybrid CNN-LSTM model

-   Evaluation of models using metrics such as accuracy, MSE, MAE, and
    RMSE.

-   Comparison of the predictive power of traditional versus extended
    feature sets.

-   Analysis of the impact of data volume and sector-specific factors on
    model performance.

**Data**

This project uses historical stock market data for Apple Inc. You can
download the dataset from sources such as [[Yahoo
Finance]{.underline}](https://finance.yahoo.com/),
[[Kaggle]{.underline}](https://www.kaggle.com/), or other financial data
providers. Ensure the dataset includes the following features:

-   **High**: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.

-   **Low**: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.

-   **Volume**: The number of shares traded during the trading day.

-   **Open**: The opening price of the stock.

-   **HiLo**: The difference between the high and low prices.

-   **OpSe**: The difference between the open and close prices.
